Installing Windows 10 or Windows Server is very frustating especially if you don't use any Automation Tool like MDT or SCCM. Even if you need to click next, next, next... bla bla bla thay after everything you need to instll multiple updates what will take a bunch of your free time. 

On that post I will show you what is OSDBuilder and what to work with that small, but much powerfull PowerShell module!

## What is a OSDBuilder?

Let's quickly visit author site - [osdbuilder](https://osdbuilder.osdeploy.com/) and check description:

> OSDBuilder is a PowerShell module to help you perform Offline Servicing to a Windows Operating System Image. By using an Offline method of configuring an Operating System, it can then be imported in MDT or SCCM and used like any other OS Deployment. This includes being able to use in an Upgrade Task Sequence, which you cannot do with a Captured Image.
> The main difference between OSDBuilder and other scripted methods for Servicing a Windows Image Offline is that OSDBuilder creates an answer file called a Task (think Task Sequence). Since the Task has all the information it needs to update the Windows Image, there is no interaction necessary, and as long as the content (updates) are updated regularly, the Task can be repeated as needed.
> Since the configuration is also saved in a Task, it is possible to select multiple tasks to run, and they will execute one right after another. This makes performing a monthly update take a few minutes to kick off. After a few hours, everything will be complete!

Sounds great? Ok, let's start with build some first of images!

First you need to open a new PowerShell terminal with Administrator priviligies and make a new directory where we will be working. I will create a new directory on my **E** drive named OSDBuilder

If you have that done, second step is install and import module using two commands:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name OSDBuilder -Force
Import-Module -Name OSDBuilder -Force
```

As you can see - on last command I'm checking what commands are available for me.

Next step is check OSDBuilder settings:

```powershell
Get-OSDBuilder
```

As you can see on the screen, default path is C:, but I want to move it to E drive, so I will use command:

```powershell
OSDBuilder -SetPath E:\OSDBuilder
```

Let's import some images from ISO and start adding updates. First, you need to mount ISO on your system and as second - you need to use command

```powershell
Import-OSMedia
```

You will see a view with images on scanned ISO - please select a ISO what you want to customize.

When import will be completed, you should inject the newest Windows Updates. For that use command: 

```powershell
Update-OSMedia -Download -Execute
```
!["Create your own Windows Image with the newest updates!](/assets/images/posts/OSDBuilder_1/04.png)

That command will invoke a popup to select imported earlier image. Will take a bunch of time so you need to wait.

Finally, screen will be looks like that:

We are almost done...

Now we will integrate the *NetFX3* - .net Framework 3.5 using. First, you need to create a task. As you see i'm using name of task: "Win10 Pro TestBlog Enable NetFX3".

!["Create your own Windows Image with the newest updates!](/assets/images/posts/OSDBuilder_1/06.png)

On the end, we need to use command: 

```powershell
New-OSBuild -Download -Execute -ByTaskName "Win 10 Pro TestBlog Enable NetFX3"
```

to build a updated version of Windows.

When we created a new
```powershell
New-OSDBuilderISO
```
