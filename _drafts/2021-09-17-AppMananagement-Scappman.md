![How to start using Group Licensing in the AAD?](/assets/images/posts/2021/Scappman-01/top.jpg)What if I told you that you can deploy more than 220 different application to your organization in couple of clicks?

When I was working on my previous company, I didn't realized that software packaging can be a so difficult work. On my current job I started working with a software packing. Isn't a easy job. You need to have a big exprience on that to create a properly working packages.

But what if you receive information, that in your package which you provided to end-users is some bug, which can be affecting to security of the whole organization? You NEED TO re-package software as soon as you can using a new package installation files provided by Vendor.

Looks easy, yes? For one application - yes. For two - also yes. For five? Can be.

For 100 different application? Not really. Because you need to follow pages related to CVE's.

If you have a team for that - can be easier.

If you are an Administrator in the small company - you propablly don't have a much of time for that. End-users need to have a newest version of Chrome, Firefox, another usefull software. They can install it manually? Emm... Nope.

Standard users should not have a local administrator account. Especially, for the software installation. I wrote about this multiple times.

Just don't do this.

You propably hear about PatchMyPC - yes? This is a service, software for publishing another software packages. Everything what you need to do - is install software, configure it and select what application you want to deploy to what group of users etc. And after that - nothing more. Newer version of application can be deployed automatically to the end-users if newer version will be available. You don't need to take care of checking security pages to check if your packages has any of security issues. Or if is newer version with some features which can help your users to be more productive etc.

You don't need to do ANYTHING MORE.

But...

If I can tell you, that you can do this same steps which I described earlier, without using **OWN SERVER(S)**? 

Did you hear about **Scappman**? 

No?

So - let's welcome Scappman on the board!

Using Scappman - you don't need to have own servers. Everything what you need is - an account with a proper permissions (Need to confirm what type of account, I used my Global Administrator account for that. But if your use account with less permissions, will great) and - buy specific numbers of licenses - depending of numbers of users who will be using Scappman. Propabbly - whole organization.

oooooooooooooooo???
