![Remote help: a new remote assistance tool from Microsoft - basic implementation](/assets/images/top_images/Microsoft365TOP.png)My look to the new Remote Assistance tool from Microsoft and how to set up it.

During last Ignite Microsoft provided information that new Remote Assistance tool is in public preview. That means, every customer can use it on own tenant.

I also decided to check this feature and I will show you how to configure it and use it.

First thing what we need to do is enable this feature on the "Connectors and tokens" > Remote Help (Preview)
