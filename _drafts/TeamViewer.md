In this article, I will show you how to configure TeamViewer to start working in your organization..

First thing what should be do is connecting MEM with TeamViewer.

You need to logon to the MEM console with account which has a permissions to manage connectors: Remote Assistance: Read and Update.

After that, you should select a acccount with a proper permissions which you're used on the MEM console. When connection will be successfully, you will receive a beatitul information on screen:

```

Basically, from the most requirement configuration it is eveything.
