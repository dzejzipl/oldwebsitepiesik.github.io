Yep, I do this again. This time I spend some time before the small public to tell them how to use Powershell and Microsoft Graph.

The basic idea in that presentation that makes a script to automatically update my OneNote which is stored on Sharepoint with all information about groups and users belongs to that groups.

Some day I will start writing more about that topic because is very interesting! 

Presentation in the Polish language you can find [here](https://itcnspl-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/jpiesik_dzejzibloguje_pl/ETUqU-N8J09NvE0bfYt2gr8BFx1JJ-JbljCj994eHXXyeA?e=ixmiSG).

Best!
