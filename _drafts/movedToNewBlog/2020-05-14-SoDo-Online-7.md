Today I was speaking on Polish virtual conference - SysOps/DevOps Online MeetUp #7 about Intune. What is it, how to integrate, and how we can use it on our small company. I show how to use it with Conditional Access, AutoPilot, etc... 

The whole presentation you can see on that [link](https://itcnspl-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/jpiesik_dzejzibloguje_pl/EeEJSbXgLpxLvn6vSKVs6AEBmetiXNgPDoBjQ5DQ-_Ddfw?e=oUemgE). Please only remember that this presentation is created on the Polish language.

Thanks!
