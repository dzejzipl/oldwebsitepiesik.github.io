![Public speaking - About Intune and Powershell / Microsoft Graph](/assets/images/top_images/Microsoft365TOP.png) Three public speakings during the COVID time.

COVID time is difficult for us. There is no face-to-face meeting during the speakings. All old "standard" things need to be done Online. What with conferences? We need to stay as "normal" as we can, so I decided to provide three public speakings for people. 

First was about Microsoft Graph and Powershell, second and third was about Microsoft Intune - for small companies and how to use it.

That was a good decision - learn other people something new.

But stay tuned. Something new is in the air! :)
