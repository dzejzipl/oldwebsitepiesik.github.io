![Synology DS620Slim - Part three](/assets/images/top_images/SynologyTOP.jpg) Backup, backup everywhere! Use Active Backup for Business or HyperBackup to have your data safe!

Uh, part three finally finished.

In part two I have written that I will be showing more information about DLNA and sharing multimedia from NAS to my TV, but I decided to write one, a big article about backup data on your home lab.

In this article, I want to show you what is Active Backup for Business and Hyper Backup, how to configure, and how to use it for daily basics.

First, let's look at previous posts. On the [first part](https://www.piesik.me/2020/11/29/Synology-Part1/) I configured NAS and storage. On the [second part](https://www.piesik.me/2020/12/12/Synology-Part2/) I created some users, groups, and shared folders also installed one package - Download Station.

Let's move to the third part - manage the backup of your machines and Synology device.

What is the main purpose of that post?

I want to configure the backup of my primary workstation (Huawei Device), also configure the backup of my whole home lab and virtual machines, and... backup important files on which I'm working (documents and screen recordings to separate Pendrive)

## First, I will show you something about **Hyper Backup**.

Hyper Backup is software downloaded from an internal store, which can be used to configure multiple types of backup, like:

* From Local folder and USB to external Storage
* Remote NAS device
* Synology C2 Storage
* RSYNC and WebDAV
* Also, it is working properly with multiple cloud services

Let's see how it looks on the welcome screen:

![Synology DS620Slim - Part three](/assets/images/posts/2021/Synology-3/01.png)

What is important for you - if you're using this software with cloud providers, it is working only to one side: **FROM** your local NAS to cloud.

Ok, so, for example, I have two very important folders, which I want to have with me on my Pendrive. In this case, I'm using **JetFlash 890** with 64GB which have ***DUAL USB 3.1 Gen 1** ports - that means I have standard USB port and USB type C port. That is very important because I can connect this Pendrive directly to my phone with USB type C. Also, there is no issue connecting it to a standard USB port.

Amazing, right? With 64GB of space, there are multiple possibilities to use it. It is very small - only ~30 mm x 15mm x 9mm. I have 64GB of version, but there are also 32GB and 128GB of sizes.

What is also important, this Pendrive supports OTG function on Android.

So, first I want to configure backup from the local NAS device to my Pendrive. To do this, you need to open *Hyper Backup*, start creating a new task, and select "Local Version & USB" or use *Single Version* if you don't need versioning of your files. I don't need to.

In the first step, I need to decide where I want to store my data. I will select **USBShare2**.

The second step is to select which data you want to backup. I'm selecting two folders that I want to copy. On the next step, I don't want to copy any of the applications so I'm skipping that step. The last step is very important to us because we need to provide the task name, the directory on dedicated media where we will be storing this backup, check multiple configuration options, and also - set up a schedule for this backup.

One important piece of information from me - select **Reserve the backed up files at the destination**. This will allow us to prevent mistakes in removing files, but for some of you - that option will be not required. Depends on the requirements of backup.

As you can see, my backup is set up daily for 11 PM. That is something good for me because if I will be leaving my home and going for example to the office, where I don't have access to my NAS device I will have work files with me. I just need to remember to have a Pendrive with me.

Sounds good?

In one of my next (short) posts, I will show you how to configure Hyper Backup to works with Azure to manage the backup of your data to the cloud.

## And another hero... Active Backup For Business.

Active Backup for Business is software that can be used to manage backup in your environment. It allows you to backup:

* PC's
* Physical servers
* File servers
* also... Virtual machines.

I've used it to make a backup of my primary device - Huawei Matebook D and also to make a copy of each of my HP Prodesk / Elitedesk used on my home lab.

### Why?

Because it is free for Synology NAS owners. You don't need to buy additional software.

Everything that you need to do is configure tasks, install software on the end-user device/server, etc, and logon using the proper account. Nothing less, nothing more. The backup will be done automatically.

I was thinking about using another software, like Veeam software to manage backup in my environment, but I can be sure, that Synology Active Backup for Business will be enough for my purposes. Also, I'm pretty sure, that will fill all of your requirements.

### Template first

Before you configure any of the devices, you should create a new **template**. A template will allow you which user/group can do a specific backup that you create on this step.

In the first step, you're naming the template, choosing to what users/groups this template is applied, selecting the platform, and choosing what is the device type.

![Synology DS620Slim - Part three](/assets/images/posts/2021/Synology-3/03.png)

In the second step, you need to define if you want to backup system volume or the entire device (with external drives). You can also choose if you want to compress or encrypt data during backup.

In the next step, you should select a backup destination. You can use the predefined folder: *ActiveBackupForBusiness* or select your own.

Next, you need to schedule a backup. You can do manual backup or schedule backup using actions or by a specific time. Daily, weekly, at a specific hour, etc... Or by event: Screen locked, signing out, or startup.

If this step is done, you need to configure the retention policy. How many versions, for how long time, etc you want to store your backup.

If templates are created...

### Install software on the device.

You need to download Active Backup software on the end-user device, provide the username/password which was assigned to the template and provide the server name.

Nothing more, nothing less.

### Backup is in progress.

This action is automatic. The backup is in progress in the background.

### Restore portal

If everything is ok, you don't need to use that portal.

But what if the user or you delete some files/folders and you need to restore those files. How to do this?

From the top menu, select **Active Backup for Business Portal**. A new page will be opened.

End-user can do this own if this user-installed software with their credentials.

![Synology DS620Slim - Part three](/assets/images/posts/2021/Synology-3/04.png)

1) This is the timeline. Select the date from which you want to restore the file.
2) Folder selection
3) File selection
4) Logged in user
5) Assigned task. There could be multiple tasks if your user has permissions to more than one machine

If you want to restore a specific file/folder, right-click on file/folder and click restore.

Simple as easy.

### Hyper-V backup

There is a great option to backup whole virtual machines. You can connect to your Hyper-V hosts and select, which machines should be copied.

Like on my screen:

This is not everything, which I want to describe today. There will be another information on the next post, but... not today.

Stay tuned!
