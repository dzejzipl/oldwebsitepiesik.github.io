![Windows and Office deployment lab kit](/assets/images/posts/2021/DeploymentLab/top.jpg)Learn how to work with Endpoint (Configuration) Manager with Windows and Office deployment lab kit!

There could be some situations when you need to learn how to work with Endpoint Manager. Not only this from Cloud, but also with this one which we have on the on-premise environment.

Creating an environment from the beginning takes much time and you need to know how to do this.

What if Microsoft provided something special for us, which can help you learn how to work with Endpoint Configuration Manager, Desktop Analytics, and many other features?

They have created something which is named **Windows and Office deployment lab kit**, which can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/modern-desktop-deployment-and-management-lab).

In a couple of words, what we can find in this lab?

* Windows 10 Enterprise, Version 20H2
* Windows 7 Enterprise
* Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Version 2010*
* Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit for Windows 10
* Microsoft Deployment Toolkit
* Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V)
* Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring
* Windows Server
* Microsoft SQL Server

As I said earlier, all basic things are configured. Everything you need to do is create a test tenant for Azure AD, obtain some trial licenses and start learning and working with that lab.
