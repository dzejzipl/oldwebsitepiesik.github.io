![Microsoft Ignite - March 2021. Cloud Skills Challenge](/assets/images/posts/2021/Ignite2021/top.jpg)Another chance to get a free voucher for Microsoft Exams!

I like to write posts like this one.

In the next couple of days will be Microsoft Ignite. One of the biggest Microsoft Events, where MS providing information about technologies, products, exams, and providing sessions with experts.

The event this year is starting on 2th of March to the 4th of March.

You need to register [here](https://register.ignite.microsoft.com/)

Ok, what with this voucher?

This year is also available **Cloud Skill Challenge**.

The link to submit a request when Challenge will be available is [here](https://csc.docs.microsoft.com/ignite/registration/March2021?wt.mc_id=ignite2021spring_learningzonehome_webpage_wwl)

When you finish one of the required challenges, you will receive a voucher for one of the exams:

* AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator
* DP-100: Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure
* MS-700: Managing Microsoft Teams
* MS-100: Microsoft 365 Identity and Services
* MS-101: Microsoft 365 Mobility and Security
* DA-100: Analyzing Data with Microsoft Power BI
* SC-200: Microsoft Security Operations Analyst
* SC-300: Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator
* SC-400: Microsoft Information Protection Administrator

Sounds nice? For me yes! Because I'm already registered for MS-100 and MS-101 exams, I will register for MS-700... Or SC-400?  Don't know.

But I can be pretty sure, that I will finish one of the challenges!

Don't wait, register now!
