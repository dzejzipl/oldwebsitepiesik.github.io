![Deploy fonts using PSAppDeployTookit through Microsoft Endpoint Manager](/assets/images/top_images/psadt.png)A short manual about deploying fonts to end-user devices using Microsoft Endpoint Manager and PSAppDeployToolkit.

A couple of weeks ago I received a question from my colleague about how to deploy fonts to end-user devices using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune).

Earlier, I saw multiple posts on how to do this using simple PowerShell scripts. Of course - that can be done this way, but I decided to learn how to use PSADT in different cases.

So what I have done?

## PSADT part

* I downloaded a package from a GitHub page, copy files from the "Toolkit" folder to my work folder.
* In the Deploy-application.ps1 file I changed information in the *VARIABLE DECLARATION* section to information about my package.
* I copied necessary fonts to *SupportFiles* folder
* Next thing, was removing the default installation prompt because in this case, I don't need it.

```powershell
Show-InstallationWelcome -CloseApps 'iexplore' -AllowDefer -DeferTimes 3 -CheckDiskSpace -PersistPrompt
```

* Now we need to install fonts, I will show you which code I created for that purpose:

```powershell
        $fonts = Get-ChildItem -Path $dirSupportFiles
        foreach ($font in $fonts) {
            Copy-File -Path "$dirSupportFiles\$($font.name)" -Destination "$envWindir\Fonts\$($font.name)"
            if ($font.Extension -eq ".ttf") {
                $fontType = "TrueType"
            }
            else {
                $fontType = "OpenType"
            }

            Set-RegistryKey -Key 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts' -Name "$($font.baseName) $($fontType)" -Value $font.name -Type String
        }
```

Code is very simple - get all fonts from the SupportFiles folder, copy them to the Fonts folder and register it in the registry

* From PSADT it's is everything. We don't need to do anything else.

## Microsoft Win32 Content Prep Tool

1) You need to pack the earlier created package to the .intunewin file. The whole process I described [here](https://www.piesik.me/2019/09/06/Azure-Information-Protection-as-Win32App/#).

## MEM part

* You need to login into the MEM portal and add a new Win32 application. Select created earlier package and provide the necessary information.
* For Installation command use: **%windir%\sysnative\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -file "Deploy-Application.ps1"**
* For uninstallation command you can use: **%windir%\sysnative\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -file "Deploy-Application.ps1 -DeploymentType Uninstall"** but in my script there is no uinstallation commands.
* Because I'm installing it for everyone in the company, I selected System as Install behavior.
* As detection rule I provided to check if a file with the font exists in the C:\Windows\Fonts folder.
* In the end, I assigned **as required** for all devices.

How it is finally look in Installation Status?

I'm planning more posts about PSADT because I'm in love with that software.

Thanks for reading!
