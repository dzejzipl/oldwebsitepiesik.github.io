![All blog posts about Microsoft technologies in one place?](/assets/images/top_images/Microsoft365TOP.png)What if you could read all blog posts about Microsoft technologies in one place?

Hello everyone.

I decided to create that post to inform you that I want to create a portal where you as the reader can read all posts about Microsoft technologies in one place. Something like **Feedly**, but with content provided by people who are creating blog posts about those technologies.

How it will works?

For example, you're a content creator and want to add your blog to my platform. So, you need to create an account (using the email address and password), add a link to your blog with RSS (for example myblog.com/feed) and that's it! You can also add any other information, for example description for blog, cover photo etc. 

There will be a cron job to check every blog if there is any new content and will be displayed on my portal. I'm planning to add a feed with direct links to your blog.

I don't want to ear any money. It's my own project. 

Sounds interesting? 

I plan to create that platform next month and everyone will be able to join to share their posts. 

If you have another idea what can be done here - I'm always ready to the conversation. You can ping me on Facebook, Twitter, email or below this post - using *Disqus*.

And thanks for reading!
