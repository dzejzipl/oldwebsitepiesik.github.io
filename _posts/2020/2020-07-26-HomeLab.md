![My home lab](/assets/images/top_images/HomeLab.jpg) Couple words about my home lab.

I decided to write this post to share with you some information about my home lab and how it's built and describe to process what I build my lab.

Last time I decided to sell some devices and buy a new one - to have four similar devices and what is most important - it's not taking much of space and it's quiet. Why? It is stored under my desk :D

Ok, so let's start from the beginning. 

I have four devices:

* HP Prodesk 600 G2 DM
* HP Elitedesk 705 G2 DM
* HP Prodesk 600 G1 DM
* HP Prodesk 600 G1 DM

And one more - Synology DS620Slim as NAS storage.

Everything is connected to Mikrotik hAP acÂ², which has a different subnet for my lab.

Let's talk about the specifications of those machines:

* HP Prodesk 600 G1 DM - 8GB of RAM, i5-4570T, 120GB of SSD disk and this machine is named: HV01
* HP Prodesk 600 G1 DM - 8GB of RAM, i5-4570T, 120GB of SSD disk with name - HV02
* Hp Prodesk 600 G2 DM - 16GB of RAM, i3-6100T, 2x250GB of SSD Disks - with name HV03
* HP EliteDesk 705 GB DM - 8GB of RAM, AMD PRO A6-8500B processor with 120GB of SSD disk and it's named HV04
* Finally, I will have connected Synology as a HyperVisior where will be installed other virtual machines named HV05

What with the roles of those devices?

* **HV01** will have installed Windows Server Standard with GUI with Hyper-V role. On this Hyper-V I will create three machines:
    * Windows Server Standard AD DS + DNS (named *HV01-M01*)
    * Windows Server Standard with GUI for AAD Connect (named *HV01-M02*)
    * Windows Server Standard with GUI for WAC - Windows Admin Center (*HV01-M03*)
* **HV02** will have installed Windows Server Standard with GUI with Hyper-V role. On this Hyper-V I will create only one machine:
    * Windows Server Standard with GUI for SCCM installation with (*HV02-M01*)
* **HV03** - this will be Windows Server Standard with GUI with Hyper-V role installed. On these machines, I will have test machines with Windows 10 / Windows Server to work with Intune and SCCM. 
    * Name convention - *HV03-M**. 
* **HV04** - it's a "bare-metal" machine with physical TPM 2.0 - this allows me to deploy AutoPilot / SCCM lab scenarios that need physical TPM 2.0. This machine will be usually Windows 10.
* **HV05** - I decided to create on beginning two machines on this Synology:
    * *HV05-01* - Installed Windows Server without GUI to replicate AD DS + DNS
    * *HV05-02* - Installed Without Server without GUI to install WDS (Windows Deployment Services) and allow to install images without using pen drives / working with MDT. 

As you can see - there is no WSUS role on any of these machines. I need to think about buying 16GB of RAM and replace it on *HV02*, so on this machine will be two virtual machines.

Ok, we have described my infrastructure, but what is a general-purpose for that blog post?

I  want to create another series of posts (one more, yes, but maybe this one I will finish :/) where I'm describing how you can create a powerful home lab for SCCM and Intune. 

That is the general purpose of this series.

I will be updating this post when I create any new posts about my home lab.
