![My home lab](/assets/images/top_images/HomeLab.jpg)Second post about my Home Lab.

Did you remember my [last post](https://www.piesik.me/2020/07/26/HomeLab/) about my home lab?

There are two changes: HV01 now has a 16GB of RAM and a second hard drive: M.2 120GB. For lab purposes, it's enough. Now I will be able to install the WSUS machine too on this hardware. 

What is progress with general installation?

I installed three Windows Server on HV01, HV02, and HV03, updated it, and installed the Hyper-V role. 

After installing a Hyper-V role there was a time to create three machines on HV01 - which will be used for:

* AD DS + DNS - **HV01-M01**
* Azure AD Connect - **HV01-M02**
* WAC + RAST - **HV01-M03**

The next step was to install *AD DS + DNS* roles on the **HV01-M01** machine. That was done by using GUI - so nothing special. Domain has Windows Server 2016 level - so newest which we can use. 

A domain name is: **piesik.online**.

After the configuration of Active Directory, I joined all of those machines to my AD. Now it looks like this:

And what's interesting - you can see that I created my own *Site* to have all (two servers ;)) AD on one site. Maybe there will be a possibility to create a new *Site* on the future and make some fun configuration later. 

About Sites and Services you can [read here](https://www.piesik.me/2019/11/19/Active-Directory-Sites-and-Services/#). It's a post on the Polish language. 

Now it's everything. In the next part, we will configure WAC + Remote Server Administration Tools to manage all of those servers from one machine.

Thanks!
