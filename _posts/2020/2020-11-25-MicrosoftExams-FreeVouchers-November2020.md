![Microsoft Exams - Free vouchers for exams. Version for November 2020](/assets/images/top_images/MSExamsTOP.jpg) Everyone loves free vouchers for exams!

Usually, when we want to try to pass the Microsoft exam we need to pay for it. Depending of the country, it's a bunch of money. For Poland, it is 110$. This is a lot of money.

But what if we don't have money and we want to start passing the exams? Microsoft is giving us help hand!

There is something like **Microsoft Virtual Training Days**!

You need to open this webpage: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trainingdays and try to find a proper event for you.

For now, you can receive a free voucher for:

* Exam **AZ-900**. For this you need to register for: *Microsoft Azure Virtual Training Day: Fundamentals*
* Exam **PL-900**. For this you need to register for: *Microsoft Power Platform Virtual Training Day: Fundamentals*
* Exam: **MB-901**. For this you need to register for: *Microsoft Dynamics 365 Virtual Training Day: Fundamentals*

And if you're impacted by COVID-19 you can check this link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/skillingoffer to get the possibility to pass the exam which will be cost only 15$.

Earlier, there was a possibility to receive a voucher for any of the exam if you're attending on Microsoft Build event. 

If I receive new information about free vouchers - I will create a new blog post about it. Thanks!
