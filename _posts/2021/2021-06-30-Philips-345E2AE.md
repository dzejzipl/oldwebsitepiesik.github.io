![Quick review: Philips LCD UltraWide Display 345E2AE](/assets/images/posts/2021/Philips-345E2AE/Top.jpg)Can I use one big display with WQHD instead of two 24' with FHD?

To be honest - I don't know how my time per day I'm spending while I'm working. There are days when I'm starting at 6 AM and ending and 5 PM, but there are days when I'm starting at 9 AM and ending at 4 PM... In any case - that it is a lot of time when I'm working. For daily work, I'm using a laptop computer connected to my docking station. From this docking station, I had connected two FHD Dell displays. With a third display built into my laptop was enough. I don't need any additional screen for any of the activities in which I'm working.

They're also an additional, third display - but it is connected to different devices not related to my daily job.

But those two's Dell displays are different. They are not the same model. Also, the arm to which I'm mounting the displays are not of good quality - so that is an additional problem.

So - I asked a colleague who is working for Philips if there is any possibility to test something which has 34' and has a 3440 x 1440 resolution.

Yep, we have something for you! We will send you a **345E2AE** for the test! Thank you, guys!

So, that text is my quick review of the usage of this display.

I started with disconnecting my old displays, removing the arm from the desk, and what a surprise - I have a big desk oO. So, the monitor was in place, let's start connecting it. I can use two HDMI ports or Display Port to connect my device. So - that means, in one time you can have connected three devices. And use technology named **MultiView** to display a view from two devices. Can be a Picture in Picture or... Two sources next to each other.

I used that, but I prefer to use PIP for small activities, like the autopilot enrollment while I was testing it on my standard PC, not a laptop. The second function can be used when you want to connect two laptops to one display - can be functional, but not in my case. I need to have one big display.

This display also has a function named LowBlue - it's something which helps to reduce blue light from the display and help our eyes. That was the first option that I turned on on my device. I'm always using it. Those colors are different on the display? That is not a problem for me. I'm doing "office" work instead of graphics, so I don't need "real" colors. About this function on the Philips site we can read:

> Studies have shown that just as ultra-violet rays can cause eye damage, shortwave-length blue light rays from LED displays can cause eye damage and affect vision over time. Developed for wellbeing, the Philips LowBlue Mode setting uses smart software technology to reduce harmful shortwave blue light.

Because I'm not playing on my laptop's / computer I wasn't able to test something named AMD FreeSync™ technology. But this device has it. What is that technology?

> Gaming shouldn't be a choice between choppy gameplay or broken frames. With the new Philips monitor, it doesn't have to be. Get fluid, artifact-free performance at virtually any frame rate with AMD FreeSync™ technology, smooth, quick refresh, and ultra-fast response time.

Ah, I'm not even watching the Nextflix on this display. I have a TV for that case :(

A piece of quick information about the resolution for that display. It's a 3440 x 1440. That is 21:9 format. It is a good resolution for multitasking. You can pin two, big windows from the left and right side and everything is visible. In my cases, I mostly used an RDP connection to machines and tools for providing changes to our work environment. If you're not a fan of pinning windows to the left / right side, you can resize them and have more than 4 opened applications at one time.

And more information about this resolution - if you want to improve your job to manage opened software, please read it about [PowerToys and FancyZones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones). I will create later article about this.

~~There was one big disadvantage to this device. The stand. CANNOT BE REGULATED! If you want to increase the height of the monitor - it is not possible. You need to use a dedicated desk-mounted arm that you mount by VESA. But buying a desk stand for that big of the monitor can be very expensive. Please remember about that.~~

Update for now.
The stand can be regulated. Didn't realized earlier that can be regulated. Sorry for that.

But how looks the work with that device?

Was amazing. Seriously, I started thinking to sell my old displays and buy one big, especially with a big resolution. It's easy to work on one display. No need for additional power cables for the second (or even third) display. No need for additional HDMI / Display Ports cables. PIP or MultiView can be used if I need to connect an additional device. It was very helpful.

Extra-wide view angles were very helpful in some of the situations.

What was on the package? Standard things like the User Manual, HDMI cable, dedicated power supply, and Display Port cable. Nothing more, nothing less. Everything that you need to start your work.

Daily usage of that device was a pleasure. In that case, I can fully say that if the display is bigger - is better. But should have also a proper resolution. I don't need to use a 34' screen with FHD resolution.

If I can buy a new display - I will check displays created by Philips. Because they creating good quality products with not a cheap price, but fully acceptable

By the way - the third, additional monitor was also produced by Philips. I'm bought it after testing a similar model. Yep, the power of recommendation and testing.
