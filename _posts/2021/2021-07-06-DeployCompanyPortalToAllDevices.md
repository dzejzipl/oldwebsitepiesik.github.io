![Deploy Company Portal Application to all devices in your organization!](/assets/images/posts/2021/DeployCompanyPortalToAllDevices/top.jpg)How to Deploy Company Portal to be installed for every user?

In the last post, I described how to connect MSfB with MEM. In today's post, I want to show you how to deploy the Company Portal application to each device. After that - all users will have installed the application on their own device.

Like in the previous post, first you need to get the Online version of the application and sync the Store.

After a while, the Company Portal application will be installed on the user device(s).
