![Something is changing...](/assets/images/top_images/QuestionMarkTOP.jpg)Just want to know you that something is changing with my blog.

I started moving to the new platform with changing the backend - from GitHub pages to Wordpress. Again.

So, basically - posts from this site will be moved to the new one - and they can be found on the new.piesik.me URL.

So - if something is missing, sorry. But I will finish moving everything to end of the October.

Thanks for understanding!
